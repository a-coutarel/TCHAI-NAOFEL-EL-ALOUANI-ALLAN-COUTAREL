## Choice of technologies
For this project, we have chosen to use Python as main programming language, the Flask web framework and the SQLite database management system.Our choices are motivated by several considerations:

### 1. Simplicity and ease of learning
Python is renowned for its clear syntax and its ease of learning, which makes it an ideal choice, especially in an educational context.Flask, as a minimalist web framework, shares this philosophy of simplicity, allowing rapid and efficient web development.

### 2. Speed of development
Flask offers rapid development of web applications while allowing in -depth personalization.Its modular approach allows us to add features as our project develops, which is particularly useful given our time constraint.

### 3. Flexibility and total control
Flask offers us the flexibility necessary to design an application that specifically meets our needs.Using Flask, we have total control over the structure of our application, which is essential to achieve our design objectives.

### 4. Abundant documentation and active community
Python, Flask and Sqlite benefit from large developer communities and many online documentation resources.This provides us with quick access to relevant information and solutions to any problems that we could encounter during development.

### 5. SQLite for data management
We have opted for SQLite as a database management system because of its simplicity and its transparent integration with Python.For our project, which involves relatively simple data storage, SQLite offers a light and effective solution without requiring complex configuration.

### 6. Portability and compatibility
Python being an interpreted language, our application will be portable and will be able to run on any platform compatible with Python.This guarantees coherent user experience, regardless of the execution environment.

In summary, our choice of Python, Flask and SQLite is based on their simplicity, their speed of development, their flexibility, their exhaustive documentation and their compatibility.These technologies allow us to create a robust and functional web application that meets our requirements while offering us the possibility of demonstrating our programming and application design skills.


## Exercise 4
After executing the following request `SELECT * FROM transactions;` on the database, we obtain the following result:
`(1, 1, 2, 150.0, '2023-11-13 21:36:58.939091')`.  
It means that the transaction with the ID 1 has been created between the person with the ID 1 and the person with the ID 2, the amount of the transaction is 150.0â‚¬ and the date of the transaction is 2023-11-13 21:36:58.939091.  
We ran the SQL request `UPDATE transactions SET amount = 100 WHERE id = 1` to change the amount of the transaction with the ID 1 to 100â‚¬.
Now, if we execute the request `SELECT * FROM transactions;` on the database, we obtain the following result:
`(1, 1, 2, 100.0, '2023-11-13 21:36:58.939091')`.  
The amount of the transaction with the ID 1 has been changed to 100â‚¬, it can be a potential security vulnerability because it is possible to change the amount of a transaction after it has been created.  
The script can be found in the file `tests/tests.ipynb`.

# TchaÃ® v2

The hash function used in the code is SHA-256. This hash function is employed to generate a hash token for each transaction carried out.

SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that takes input of any size and converts it into a fixed output of 256 bits. This means that once an input is hashed using SHA-256, it will consistently produce the same 256-bit output, regardless of the original input size. Furthermore, the hash function is a one-way operation, implying that it is highly challenging, if not impossible, to deduce the original input from the hash output.

In this code, the hash function is utilized to create a hash token for every transaction performed. Transaction data is converted into a string (str(transaction_data)), then encoded into bytes (encode()). The sha256() function from the hashlib library is employed to create the hash token. Finally, the hexdigest() function is used to return the hash token as a hexadecimal string.

The choice of SHA-256 is a sound one as it is considered secure and widely used in security applications for reliably generating hash tokens.

## Exercise 6
To know if the transactions are valid, you have to send a `GET` request to the route `localhost:5000/transaction/check-hash`.
#### Request Parameters

No parameters required.

#### Responses
| HTTP Status | Response     | Description                                                  |
|-------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200         | OK           | List of all transactions with the information valid or not.  |

## Exercise 7
To address this potential security vulnerability, the transactions table in the database has been updated to include a hash column. This column stores the hash of each transaction. When a transaction is retrieved, the program computes the hash of the transaction data and compares it with the stored hash in the database. If the two hashes do not match, it indicates that the transaction data has been altered manually after its creation, and the program will raise an error. This mechanism ensures the integrity of the transaction data and prevents unauthorized modifications.  
A demonstration of this mechanism can be found in the file `tests/tests.ipynb`.

## Exercise 8
While the hash column in the transactions table helps ensure the integrity of transaction data, it does not prevent rows from being deleted from the table. If a row is deleted, the corresponding transaction data is lost, which could be a potential security vulnerability. This is because unauthorized users could potentially delete transaction records, leading to loss of important data. Measures should be taken to prevent unauthorized deletion of rows from the transactions table to ensure complete data integrity and security.
The script for line deletion can be found in the file `tests/tests.ipynb`.

## Exercise 10
Exercise 10 introduces a critical enhancement to address potential security vulnerabilities in the transactions table. The modification involves updating the hash calculation method, where the hash value (hi+1) not only depends on the current transaction but also incorporates the hash value (hi) from the preceding transaction. This adjustment establishes a cryptographic link between consecutive transactions, ensuring that the integrity of transaction data is not only verified for the current entry but is also inherently connected to the previous one. By doing so, unauthorized deletion of rows from the transactions table becomes more challenging for potential attackers, as tampering with one entry would disrupt the entire chain of hashes, thus fortifying the overall data integrity and security of the system. Exercise 10 serves as a crucial validation step to confirm that the previous vulnerabilities and deletion script, as identified in the tests/tests.ipynb file, are no longer effective against the strengthened hash calculation method.
A demonstration of this mechanism can be found in the file `tests/tests.ipynb`.

## Exercise 11
In Exercise 11, the objective is to assess the system's susceptibility to an attack involving the initiation of a transaction from an existing account to that of the attacker. The script provided for this exercise attempts to execute such a transaction, specifying an existing person (ID: 2) and targeting the account of the attacker (ID: 1). The anticipated outcome is that the transaction should fail as a result of the system detecting an unauthorized transaction. This exercise serves as a crucial test to evaluate the system's robustness in preventing potentially malicious transactions that could compromise the security and integrity of financial data.
A demonstration of this mechanism can be found in the file `tests/tests.ipynb`.

## Exercice 13
The use of the asymmetric cryptography algorithm RSA in our API now allows the secure signing of banking transactions, guaranteeing user authenticity and transaction integrity.  
When a user sets up an account, he receives a private key, which is not stored on the server, ensuring their exclusive ownership. Only the public key is stored in the user table of the database.  
A demonstration of this mechanism can be found in the file `tests/tests.ipynb`.

| 400         | Bad Request       | Invalid request: Missing parameters or incorrect data.   |  

Additionally, we have established a route for users lacking the means to sign messages. The route `/transaction/sign` takes a private key and a transaction as arguments.

### Route: `/transaction/sign`
#### Parameters
| Parameter     | Type   | Description                                   |

| `private_key` | String | The private key for signing the transaction. |
| `transaction` | JSON | The transaction to be signed.  

The transaction JSON object has the following format:
```json
"private_key": "",
"transaction": {
    "p1_id": 0,
    "p2_id": 0,
    "amount": 0
  }
```
#### Responses
This route returns the signature in a JSON object:
```json
"signature": ""
```
| HTTP Status | Response         | Description                                     |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|

| 400         | Bad Request      | Invalid request: Missing parameters or incorrect private key. |

Once the user obtains his signature, he submits transaction and its signature via the designated route. The `/transaction/create` route accepts a `JSON` object with a transaction (also in JSON format) and a matching signature.
### Route: `/transaction/create`

| Parameter   | Type    | Description                                           |
|------------ |---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `transaction` | JSON  | The transaction object containing transaction  
| `signature`   | String | The signature of the given transaction  

The transaction object contains the following properties:
```json
"transaction": {
    "p1_id": 0,
    "p2_id": 0,
    "amount": 0
  }
```
The server then verifies the transaction's signature using the user's public key, previously recorded in our database.
If the signature is invalid, a 400 code is returned.
